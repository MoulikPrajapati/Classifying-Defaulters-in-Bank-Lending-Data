# Classifying-Defaulters-in-Bank-Lending-Data
To check the credit worthiness of the company/individual when they apply for loan.
In general, whenever an individual/corporation applies for a loan from a bank (or any loan issuer), their credit history undergoes a rigorous check to ensure that whether they are capable enough to pay off the loan (in this industry it is referred to as credit-worthiness). 
The issuers have a set of model/s and rule/s in place which take information regarding their current financial standing, previous credit history and some other variables as input and output a metric which gives a measure of the risk that the issuer will potentially take on issuing the loan. The measure is generally in the form of a probability and is the risk that the person will default on their loan (called the probability of default) in the future.
Based on the amount of risk that the issuer is willing to take (plus some other factors) they decide on a cutoff of that score and use it to take a decision regarding whether to pass the loan or not. This is a way of managing credit risk. The whole process collectively is referred to as underwriting.
NOTE: What I have described above is a very simplified version of the process to give you an introductory overview. You can refer to the following resources for a better understanding:
